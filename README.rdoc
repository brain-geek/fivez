= Game mechanics:
- You have grid 4x4 with(or without) numbers
- For both X and Y grid you have next 'incoming' position
- Game starts with one '2' in the [1,1] position

=== Moves

- On each move you have an opportunity to move stuff in grid (up/down, left/right)
- If move doesn't change anything - it's not allowed
- If you have free place in 'incoming' position in the direction opposite to move - you have new random number(2/3/5) added there.
- Identical numbers (or 2+3) get added and stacked.

=== Loss

- If you can't move in any direction - you lose.

=== Poins

You can get score summing all numbers higher then 5 in the grid.
